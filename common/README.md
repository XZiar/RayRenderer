A collection of useful utilities

**Some components (\*.hpp) are header-only, while some (\*.h&\*.inl) are not. (\*.h) provides declaration and (\*.inl) provides implements.**

## Main Componennts

### [CommonRely](./CommonRely.hpp)

Basic header for most of utilities here, provides compiler check and some basic utilities like `hash_string`, `MACRO OPs`, `NonCopyable/NonMovable` 

### [EnumEx](./EnumEx.hpp)

Enum enhancement.

* **`BitField`** : `MAKE_ENUM_BITFIELD(x)`
  
  `enum class` with `BitFiled` mode can be easily performed bitwise operation. `HAS_FIELD` and `REMOVE_MASK` also provide simpler usage.

* **`Range`** : `MAKE_ENUM_RANGE(x)`
  
  `enum class` with `Range` mode can be easily performed comparasion and increasment/decreasement.

It also has experiemental compile-time reflection support based on `FUNCSIG` macro. The idea comes from [magic_enum](https://github.com/Neargye/magic_enum).

### [Exception](./Exceptions.hpp)

Custom Exception model, inherit from std::runtime_error, with support of nested-exception, strong-type, Unicode message, arbitrary extra data...

### [Linq](./Linq.hpp) `**Deprecated**`

C#-like Linq implementation. It is compile-time based.

### [Linq2](./Linq2.hpp)

New implememntation of Linq. Compile-time based, proper cache strategy, proper type-passthrough, with case-based optimization.

### [Stream](./Stream.hpp)

Stream is an abstract resouce that can read data from or write data to. 

* [Stream.hpp](./Stream.hpp) provides basic stream concept and buffered wrapper.

* [MemoryStream.hpp](./MemoryStream.hpp) provides stream from memory (and specially from contiguous container).

### [SpinLocker](./SpinLocker.hpp)

Spin-lock implemented using std::atomic. 

It also provided a read-write lock(both priority supported) and a prefer-lock, both are spin-locked.

### [TimeUtil](./TimeUtil.hpp)

A utility to provide time query support, mainly used as a timer.

### [SIMD](./simd/SIMD.hpp) **`working`**

It provides SIMD support (SSE/AVX/NEON).

* [SIMD](./simd/SIMD.hpp) Basic SIMD handling.
  * Include correct header file.
  * Apply workarounds for missing functions based on compiler version.
  * Static SIMD version detection (with compiler pre-defined macros).

* [SIMD128](./simd/SIMD128.hpp) 128bit vector types, based on SSE/NEON. With `AVX/AVX2/AVX512`, or `ARMv8-ASIMD`, extra functionality or enhanced support will be provided.
  * Types: `F64x2`, `F32x4`, `I64x2`, `U64x2`, `I32x4`, `U32x4`, `I16x8`, `U16x8`, `I8x16`, `U8x16`.

Unittests can be found in [BasicsTest](../Tests/BasicsTest/).

### [RefObject](./RefObject.hpp)

An ateempt to combine intrusive refrence counting with pimpl. It natively supports type erasure and belonging ownership. 

It is used by inherit so we can expose operations natively without using `->`. However, seperating data and operation makes it harder to decide which part need to be keep by others.

### [SharedString](./SharedString.hpp)

A shared immutable string.
  
Some string is used across threads but not being modified, so they can be shared with proper lifetime management.

ShareString provides access using string_view and uses embedded reference-block to save pointer's dereference overhead.

### [EasierJSON](./EasierJSON.hpp)

A wrapper for `rapidjson`, providing strong-typed json components and easier conversions and operations.

It uses shared_ptr to implicitly manage memory resources, which will lead to more overhead than original `rapidjson`.

* **`DocumentHandle`** wraps a MemoryPoolAllocator, can be use to create new `JArray` and `JObject`.

* **`JNode`** an abstract concept of JSON node (array or object), provides functionality for `Stringify()`. Any actual node type should use CRTP to inherit from it.

* **`JDoc`** a JSON document, which is basicly a `DocumentHandle` with `JNode`'s `Stringify` support. It can only be created from `Parse()` of string.

* **`JDocRef<B>`** wraps a `JDoc`, can be const reference.

* **`JComplexType`** an abstract concept of JSON node, provides functionality for getting inner data. Any actual node type should use CRTP to inherit from it.

* **`JArrayLike`** an abstract concept of JSON array, it uses `rapidjson::SizeType` as KeyType of `JComplexType`.

* **`JObjectLike`** an abstract concept of JSON object, it uses `common::u8StrView` as KeyType of `JComplexType`.

* **`JArray`** actual JSON array, uses `Push` to add data.

* **`JArrayRef<B>`** wraps a `JArray`, can be const reference.

* **`JObject`** actual JSON array, uses `Add` to add data.

* **`JObjectRef<B>`** wraps a `JObject`, can be const reference.

### [StringEx](./StringEx.hpp)

Some useful utilities for string operationsã€‚

* `ToStringView` convert an arg to a string_view, support type with `value_type` and str pointer.
* `IsBeginWith` similar functionality for C++20's `*.starts_with()`
* `ifind_first` case-insensitive find for string.

### [StringLinq](./StringLinq.hpp)

provide Linq-based string split operation. It is simply based on brute find, and there's no optimized implements like KMP or SSE4.2 intrin.

### [Controllable](./Controllable.hpp)

A base class using type erasure to support dynamic property access. object's property need to be registered explicitly.

**Controllable stores data inside the instance, so multi-inherited class may consider using virtual inheritance.**

**Controllable will soon be moved into a standalone dynamic library project to provide better metadata management**

### [SharedResource](./SharedResource.hpp)

An auto management for shared resource.
  
Some resources need to be shared among classes or instances, hence they are often defined as "static".
"static" variable will be initialized when the first time it's reached, however, there is no promise when they will be destroyed.

Shared_ptr can be used to automatically manage resource since the inner resource will be automatically destroyed when the last one release it. This provide the missing part of "static".

SharedResource is designed to provide a determined lifespan for a shared resource.
The resource will be generated only someone ask for it, and will be destroyed when it is no longer held by anyone.
If there's another ask for resource after it destroy it, it will generate the resource again.
However, since itself should be defined as static, its' lifespan can not be promised.

Though shared_ptr itself has provided thread-safety promise, SharedResource itself should also manually provide it, since several thread may ask for resource at the same time, while only one resource should be generated.
I brutally use a spin-lock, which may lead to a disaster when multiple threads trying to acquire the resource that hasn't been generated --- they will be blocked and spin, causing high CPU usage.
Also, it uses weak_ptr to keep track of resource, whose lock method will cause some overhead.

The best practise should be acquiring the resource only once, and keep a copy of it until finish using it.

## Container Components

### [AlignedBase](./AlignedBase.hpp)

Provide aligned memory management. Strict aligned malloc `malloc_align` is provided just as `std::aligned_alloc`. Weak aligned malloc `mallocn_align` which support non-multiple-alignment size is also provided.

* **`AlignBase<size_t>`** custom base that support aligned memory allocation when created on heap

### [AlignedContainer](./AlignedContainer.hpp)

* **`AlignAllocator`** custom allocator that support arbitrary aligned memory management

std containers with `AlignAllocator` is defined under `common::container` as xxx**Ex**.

### [AlignedBuffer](./AlignedBuffer.hpp)

A non-typed aligned memory space, provide sub-buffer creation and shared-lifetime mamnagement(using reference counter).

It also support external memory allocation by inherit `AlignedBuffer::ExternBufInfo`.

### [ContainerHelper](./ContainerHelper.hpp)

Provides [contiguous container](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/ContiguousContainer) type check.

### [ContainerEx](./ContainerEx.hpp)

A simple library providing some shortcuts for container operations, like comparator for tupel/pair, finding element in set/map/vector, creating a iteration-view for map's key/value.

* **`FrozenDenseSet`** an immutable set, which is in fact a sorted vector.

### [IntrusiveDoubleLinkList](./IntrusiveDoubleLinkList.hpp)

Bi-direction linked list with embedded node metadata.

NodeType should use CRTP to inherit from `IntrusiveDoubleLinkListNodeBase` and it will be `NonCopyable`.

`IntrusiveDoubleLinkList` uses [WRSpinLock](./SpinLock.hpp) as lock to provide thread-safty. However, **`AppendNode` only requires ReadScope, and they in fact uses CAS to achieve lock-free.** WriteScope is used when requires double-CAS and for blocking operations like `Clear` and `ForEach`.

## System Components

### [ResourceHelper](./ResourceHelper.h)

A wrapper to manage embedded resource. It uses DLL's embedded resource on Win32 and `binary object` on *nix.

On windows, you need to manually initalize the helper in dllmain. On *nix, initilize is done be global static variable initilization.

### [DelayLoader](./DelayLoader.h)

A wrapper to manage win32 DLL's delay-load feature.
