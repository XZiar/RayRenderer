# RayRenderer #
A simple renderer based on my old RayTrace project.
It will contain mini version of BLAS library, C++ wrapper for OpenGL and GLUT, C#(WPF) GUI

### Changes from old project ###
* fixed pipeline -> GLSL shader
* x64/AVX2 only RayTracing -> multi versions of acceleration RayTracing(may also include OpenCL)
* GLUT based GUI -> simple GUI with GLUT, complex GUI with WPF
* coupling code -> reusable components
