# 3rdParty libraries

This folder includes almost all the 3rd-party libraries that RayRenderer uses.

## About Submodules

Due to historic reasons and build toolchian issue, some libs are included with source code. I am working on moving them into submodules.

## Dummy libraries

Some libraries are previously used but still remian in the repo:

* [date](https://howardhinnant.github.io/date/date.html) 2.4.1

  [MIT License](./date/LICENSE.txt)

## Libraries for test

Some libraries are only used for test app:

* [libressl](http://www.libressl.org/) 2.9.0
  
  [Apache License](./3rdParty/libressl/COPYING)

* [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) 7.63.0
  
  [Modified MIT License](./3rdParty/curl/LICENSE-MIXING.md)
