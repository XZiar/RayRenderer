# 3rdParty libraries

This folder includes almost all the 3rd-party libraries that RayRenderer uses.

It seems that the normal way is to fork each of them, and add them here by "submodule".
However, I am using Visual Studio whose github plugin has no such function for me.
Also, I am tired to find out the difference among "submodule", "subtree", etc...
